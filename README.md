üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Intelligence: Optimization and Explainable AI
Introduction
Welcome to the Retail Sales Intelligence Project, a system designed to help retailers make smarter, faster decisions about their sales and supply chain.

The Problem: Complexity and Trust
Running a retail operation is complicated. Businesses constantly face challenging questions:

"What is the most profitable way to distribute my products this week?"

"If I increase the discount on Product X, how much will my total profit change?"

Answering these questions requires optimization‚Äîusing complex math to find the very best solution among millions of possibilities. While powerful, these optimization models often produce technical, numerical answers that business managers can‚Äôt easily understand. This lack of clarity leads to a lack of trust. If a manager doesn't know why the computer chose a specific plan, they are less likely to follow it.

Our Solution: The OptiGuide Framework
Our project tackles this problem by implementing a framework inspired by the OptiGuide research paper. We combine the brute-force problem-solving power of a traditional optimization engine with the common-sense communication skills of a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system works like a smart assistant with two jobs:

The "Coder": When a user asks a "what-if" question in simple English (e.g., "What if we don't ship to the West region?"), our fine-tuned Llama 3 model translates that question directly into a piece of code that the optimization engine can understand.

The "Interpreter" (Explainable AI - XAI): After the optimization engine calculates the new best solution, the Llama 3 model takes the technical results (the numbers and log files) and translates them back into a clear, simple answer, explaining why the profit changed or why a particular decision was made.

The Outcome
This framework delivers two major benefits to the retailer:

Optimal Decisions: It ensures the business always finds the most efficient and profitable operational plan.

Trust and Clarity (XAI): It provides Explainable AI (XAI), allowing users to understand the logic behind every decision. This builds confidence in the system and ensures that the optimal plans are actually implemented.

By using your complete, unified retail sales dataset, this project is ready to provide real-world value by making complex optimization both accurate and easy to understand.
